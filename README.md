# lum.web-core-extra.js

These are useful functions and classes that are outside the scope of the
minimalistic [@lumjs/web-core] package, but are small enough that they 
don't warrant having their own standalone package.

This includes a `Wrapper` class that can handle a single element,
or a collection of elements, and provides a bunch of useful
methods and properties that in many cases simply wrap the `web-core` 
functionality in a more object-oriented shell.
 
There's not much else here yet, but this package will likely grow over time.
